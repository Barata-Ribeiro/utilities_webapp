# Utilities Web App

## 🌐 Description

The Utilities Web App is a single-page application built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and the MathJS library. Designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, the app boasts a decent router that gracefully handles various pages built as components, handles a not found page when in an inexistent route, and has a loading. This versatile utility offers a range of conversion tools, calculators, and other utilities, all delivered in a responsive design that adapts to any device or screen size. Users can effortlessly convert between different units of mass, length, temperature, and more. The app also provides calculators for general use and specific purposes like calculating Body Mass Index (BMI). The app features tools like a robust password generator and a character counter for added utility. With future plans for additional features and enhancements, the Utilities Web App is your one-stop solution for a host of everyday computational needs.
